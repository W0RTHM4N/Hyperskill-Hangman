# Hangman

My second Python project from Hyperskill.

This is a simple Hangman game, where the user must guess the word letter by letter.

The word is chosen randomly from the list: "python, java, kotlin, javascript".
The user has 8 tries. Its number is reduced every time the user enters a single unique ASCII lovercase letter, which is not in the word.
If all letters in the word has been guessed, the game ends and the user is considered a survivor.
Else the user gets hanged, so losing the game is not adviced.
